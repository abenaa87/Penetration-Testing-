# Penetration-Testing-

## Objective 
The objective of this project was to perform penetration testing to assess the security posture of a network consisting of two Linux and two Windows machines. This involved compromising one Linux machine and leveraging it to pivot onto the remaining three machines, ultimately retrieving sensitive data. The findings and methodologies were documented in a comprehensive report.

## Skills Learned 
#### Penetration Testing
- Expertise in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in Linux and Windows systems.
- Experience in conducting comprehensive security assessments.

#### Tools Proficiency
- Experience with penetration testing tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, and John the Ripper.
- Proficiency in scripting languages like Python for custom exploit development.

#### Problem Solving
- Analytical skills to troubleshoot and solve complex security issues.
- Creative thinking to find innovative solutions to bypass security measures.

#### Network Security
- Understanding of network architectures and common security protocols.
- Ability to analyze and secure network configurations.

#### Pivoting Techniques
- Proficiency in using compromised systems to access other machines within a network.
- Knowledge of lateral movement strategies and tools.

#### Linux and Windows Security
- In-depth knowledge of security practices and vulnerabilities specific to Linux and Windows operating systems.
- Experience in securing and hardening both types of systems.

#### Vulnerability Assessment
- Skill in identifying, assessing, and prioritizing vulnerabilities.
- Familiarity with tools and methodologies for vulnerability scanning.

#### Exploitation
- Ability to develop and execute exploits to gain unauthorized access to systems.
- Knowledge of post-exploitation techniques.

#### Data Retrieval
- Expertise in locating and extracting sensitive data from compromised systems.
- Understanding of data protection and encryption methods.

#### Report Writing
- Strong technical writing skills to document findings, methodologies, and remediation strategies.
- Ability to create comprehensive and clear reports for various stakeholders.
  
## Tools Used
